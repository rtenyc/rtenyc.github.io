The Car-Free Key West interactive map is a mobile-responsive web map that shows the live and up-to-date status of the Key West transportation network – including current bike infrastructure and real-time bus locations. 

The map is built using OpenStreetMap data layered on top of a custom Mapbox tile Style. Phase II of the map’s development will include real-time routing.
