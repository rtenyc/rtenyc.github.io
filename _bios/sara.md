**Sara Eichner** After working for many years as a graphic designer in educational publishing, Sara enrolled in Prattâ€™s SAVI GIS program in 2015. After completing the program she worked with the Pratt SAVI on the CreateNYC Cultural Plan for All New Yorkers. Her work uses GIS and tells stories with complex data while not losing sight of the texture and complexities of the urban geography and communities behind the data. Sara also maintains a practice as a visual artist, exhibiting in New York and around the U.S. [Visit Sara's portfolio.](https://www.saraeichnergis.com/ "Sara's Portfolio")
