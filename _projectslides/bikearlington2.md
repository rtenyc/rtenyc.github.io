The map is geared towards the 60% of interested but concerned riders, showing how simple it is to get around the county by highlighting both comfort level and infrastructure. Data was collected by the BikeArlington group with a localâ€™s understanding and perspective. Categories were created based on traffic volume, speed, and road width.
